                <ul>
                    <li><strong>February 20, 1967</strong> Cobain was born at Grays Harbor Hospital in Aberdeen, Washington, the son of waitress Wendy Elizabeth (née Fradenburg; born 1948) and automotive mechanic Donald Leland Cobain (born 1946).</li>
                    <li><strong>1976</strong> His parents divorced. He later said that the divorce had a profound effect on his life.</li>
                    <li><strong>June 28, 1979</strong> Cobain's mother granted full custody to his father.</li>
                    <li><strong>February 20, 1981</strong> Cobain's uncle offered him either a bike or a used guitar—he chose the guitar</li>
                    <li><strong>During high school</strong> Cobain rarely found anyone with whom he could play music. While hanging out at the Melvins' practice space, he met Novoselic, a fellow devotee of punk rock.</li>
                    <li><strong>1987</strong> Novoselic finally agreed to join Cobain, forming the beginnings of Nirvana.</li>
                    <li><strong>1989</strong> Nirvana recorded the album Bleach, released on Sub Pop Records</li>
                    <li><strong>1991</strong> With Grohl, the band found their greatest success through their major-label debut, Nevermind. With Nevermind's lead single, "Smells Like Teen Spirit", Nirvana entered the mainstream, popularizing a subgenre of alternative rock called "grunge". Since their debut, Nirvana has sold over 25 million albums in the United States (U.S.) alone, and over 75 million worldwide.</li>
                    <li><strong>February 24, 1992</strong> Cobain and Courtney Love were married on Waikiki Beach in Hawaii</li>
                    <li><strong> March 18, 1994</strong> Love phoned the Seattle police informing them that Cobain was suicidal and had locked himself in a room with a gun. Police arrived and confiscated several guns and a bottle of pills from Cobain, who insisted that he was not suicidal and had locked himself in the room to hide from Love.</li>
                </ul>

                    <p class="mb-0">I think that he committed suicide. I don't think there's a smoking gun. And I think there's only one way you can explain a lot of things around his death. Not that he was murdered, but that there was just a lack of caring for him. I just think that Courtney had moved on, and he was expendable.</p>
